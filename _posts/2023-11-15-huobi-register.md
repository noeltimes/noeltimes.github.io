Since its establishment in 2013, Huobi has rapidly grown to become one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Founder Leon Li's vision was to create a secure, professional, and trustworthy digital asset trading platform, and Huobi's growth trajectory has proven their success in achieving this goal.

Initially founded in China, Huobi quickly gained popularity within the cryptocurrency community due to its user-friendly interface, robust technical support, and wide selection of currencies. As the Chinese government tightened its regulatory policies on cryptocurrencies, Huobi expanded globally, relocating its headquarters to Singapore and establishing branches in various countries and regions.
