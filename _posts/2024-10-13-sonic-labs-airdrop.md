Key Takeaways
Fantom Foundation has officially rebranded to Sonic Labs ahead of the launch of its new Layer 1 blockchain, Sonic. 
Sonic aims to improve scalability and speed issues and aims to process over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with just one-second confirmation times.
Users can participate in the upcoming Sonic S token airdrop by playing games on Sonic Arcade while developers can join the Sonic Boom program.

On August 1, 2024, the Fantom Foundation officially rebranded to Sonic Labs as the project’s focus is shifting to developing Sonic, a new Layer 1 blockchain. Fantom was founded in 2018 as a platform to deliver cheap, rapid, and secure transactions to users. However, as time passed by, various shortcomings came to light including slow transactions and scalability challenges. 

The team developed Sonic to overcome these issues but found that the technological advancements could not be fully integrated into Opera through simple soft-fork upgrade. In the end, Fantom Foundation made the decision to launch an entirely new network with a new token, as well as completely rebranding to Sonic Labs to provide clarity and visibility for users, developers, and the overall community to understand the new direction.

This change includes the establishment of two distinct entities, Sonic Labs and Sonic Foundation, in order to streamline operations and foster innovation. Sonic Labs will be focusing on accelerating growth among decentralized applications (dApps) through various initiatives such as an Innovator Fund that is committing up to 200 million Sonic (S) tokens to support developers and projects transitioning to the new network. Meanwhile Sonic Foundation will manage governance and treasury functions. 

Sonic is currently running its testnet and is expected to launch sometime in November or December 2024. The new chain will be utilizing Sonic Gateway, a Layer 2 bridge that connects to Ethereum which allows the platform to leverage Ethereum’s liquidity and user base while maintaining its own high throughput and low transaction costs. 

It aims to set a new standard in the blockchain space by being able to process over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with just one-second confirmation times. Sonic Gateway will leverage Sonic’s own validator network to establish a secure channel between the two chains and also implement a built-in fail-safe mechanism for users to retrieve bridged assets if there are 14 consecutive days of failed gateway operations. 

The existing Fantom (FTM) token will be replaced by the new native S token. Upon the launch of Sonic, holders of FTM can convert their tokens to S at a 1:1 ratio. The S token can be used to pay for transaction fees, run a validator, stake in programs, and participate in governance. It will also be used in the upcoming Gateway to Ethereum but more details will be announced by the team at a later time. 

At genesis, a supply of 3,175,000,000 S will correspond to the total supply of 3,175,000,000 FTM. Additions to the S token supply will be gradually implemented as decided by multiple governance proposals. Firstly, an additional 6% of the token supply, 190,500,000 S tokens, will be minted six months after Sonic launches to be used exclusively for programs within the airdrop as a way to reward both Opera and Sonic users and builders. At the time of writing, users can participate in the Sonic Arcade to earn points while developers can start applying to the Sonic Boom bounty program. 

Part of the airdrop program includes a unique burn factor to encourage airdrop recipients to hold their allocation for longer. On the first day of the airdrop, 25% of a user’s allocation will be liquid while the remaining 75% will be vested over 270 days as NFT positions. The image below is taken from Sonic Labs and illustrates the burn amount according to the number of days remaining before the full unlock of a user's allocation. 

Users can now start earning points for the S airdrop through Sonic Arcade, a digital playground on the Sonic testnet featuring three play-to-earn games. Given the excitement around the upcoming Sonic launch and the opportunity to participate, now is a great time to get started on Sonic Arcade!  **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://eoc.page.link/85EH#78891)**
