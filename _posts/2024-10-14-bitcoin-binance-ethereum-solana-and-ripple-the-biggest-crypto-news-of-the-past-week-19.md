Between revolutionary announcements, technological evolutions, and regulatory turbulences, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a territory of boundless innovations and a field of regulatory and economic battles. Here is a summary of the most significant news of the past week about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.

!The crypto news of the week

HBO reveals the identity of Satoshi: the crypto community in turmoil
--------------------------------------------------------------------

HBO caused a shockwave within the crypto community with its documentary ‚ÄúMoney Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,‚Äù by claiming that Canadian developer Peter Todd might be the mysterious creator of Bitcoin. The film relies on circumstantial evidence suggesting that Todd used the pseudonym Satoshi to conceal his identity when he was still a student.

Online posts and his support for innovations like Replace-by-Fee (RBF) are presented as key indicators of his involvement. The crypto community remains skeptical and prefers to keep the mystery surrounding Nakamoto.

Google simplifies ETH balance management with ENS domain integration
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Google has taken another step towards cryptocurrency adoption by allowing direct search of balances associated with .eth domain names via its search bar. Thanks to this integration with Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and using data from Etherscan, users can now quickly check crypto balances without leaving Google Search.

This development aims to make cryptos more accessible by avoiding the use of complex hexadecimal addresses and minimizing the risks of errors and phishing. This feature also enhances security and improves user experience, making digital asset management more fluid. With this addition, Google confirms its commitment to supporting the blockchain ecosystem and fostering wider crypto adoption by the general public.

The FBI deploys a crypto to trap fraudsters
-------------------------------------------

The FBI has implemented an unprecedented operation by creating its own cryptocurrency, NexFundAI, to infiltrate a network of fraudsters in the crypto sector. The investigation was launched following a SEC alert concerning market manipulation involving the company Saitama.

Thanks to NexFundAI, the FBI succeeded in identifying fraudulent practices such as wash trading, used by companies like Robo Inu, VZZN, and Lilian Finance, as well as market-making firms such as Gotbit and CLS Global. The fraudsters were caught red-handed agreeing to manipulate the price of NexFundAI for compensation. This operation led to the indictment of 18 individuals and organizations, marking a historic step in the fight against crypto market manipulation.

Mt. Gox delays reimbursements: a respite for the market, a trial for creditors
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mt. Gox, victim of one of the largest hacks in crypto history, announces the postponement of its creditors‚Äô reimbursement to October 31, 2025, a year of additional delay. This decision aims to overcome the technical difficulties that have slowed down the process, although 21,000 creditors have already been partially reimbursed in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Mt. Gox‚Äôs wallet still holds 45,000 BTC (or 2.75 billion USD at the current rate), and this extension temporarily reduces the risk of a massive sell-off in the crypto market.

This respite is welcomed positively by some investors, who hope for a stabilization of Bitcoin‚Äôs price. However, the prolonged wait fuels creditors‚Äô frustration, exacerbates distrust towards centralized platforms, and strengthens the appeal of decentralized solutions.

Stripe relaunches in crypto with Solana to revolutionize e-commerce
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Stripe, an online payment giant, marks its return to the crypto sector after a six-year break by integrating stablecoin payments via Solana. The company had stopped its support of Bitcoin in 2018 due to slow transactions and volatility. Now, Stripe is betting on USDC, a stablecoin issued by Circle, which offers crucial stability for commercial transactions. US merchants can directly receive dollars, and Stripe handles the conversion.

Solana stands out with its near-zero fees and high processing speed, surpassing Ethereum and Polygon, making it an ideal choice for Stripe. This collaboration reflects a step towards broader cryptocurrency adoption in e-commerce, combining Stripe‚Äôs expertise with Solana‚Äôs performance to create a fast and reliable payment infrastructure.
