Are you ready to earn some free crypto tokens? Look no further because Ethena is here with an exciting airdrop opportunity. Ethena is a cutting-edge synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a crypto-native solution for money that is not reliant on traditional banking systems. In addition, Ethena offers a globally accessible dollar-denominated savings instrument called the ‘Internet Bond’.

🔒✨ Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, is censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable. It achieves this by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully backed transparently on-chain and can be freely composed throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

🚀 Now, here’s the exciting part: Ethena is conducting an airdrop of ENA tokens, which make up 5% of their total token supply. These tokens will be distributed to users who have interacted with Ethena and collected shards. If you’ve collected shards until April 1st, 2023, congratulations! You are eligible for the airdrop.

🎉 But wait, there’s more! Season 2 of the airdrop campaign has begun, and it comes with a twist. The “Shards” have been replaced with “Sats”. So, if you mint, provide liquidity, and stake USDe, you will continue earning sats and remain eligible for future airdrops. Plus, you can earn even more sats for each referral you bring in.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to claim your ENA tokens:

1️⃣ Visit the Ethena app page by clicking on this link: Ethena Airdrop Claim **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**
