The Ethena Airdrop is live, and participants can now earn ENA tokens through the ongoing shard campaign. Whether youâ€™re already involved with Ethena or looking to join, this guide will help you navigate the process of claiming ENA tokens and earning shards. The airdrop is an excellent opportunity to become part of the Ethena Labs ecosystem, which rewards active users who contribute to the protocol.

$ENA Airdrop Claim
What is the Ethena Airdrop?
Ethena Labs, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is distributing 750 million ENA tokens (5% of the total supply) to participants through its current shard campaign. ENA tokens are governance tokens, giving holders the ability to influence decisions about the future development of the Ethena protocol. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**

To earn these tokens, users must participate in the shard campaign, which rewards engagement with the Ethena platform, particularly through its synthetic stablecoin USDe.

How to Earn Shards in the Current Campaign
Earning shards is the key to participating in the airdrop. Shards represent user engagement and activity within the Ethena ecosystem, and they determine how many ENA tokens each user will receive. Hereâ€™s how you can earn shards right now:

Buy and Hold USDe: Purchasing and holding USDe (Ethenaâ€™s synthetic stablecoin) can earn you a steady flow of shards. This is the simplest way to participate.
Stake USDe: By staking USDe, you can increase your shard count. Staking is rewarded with 1â€“10x shards per day, depending on the amount you have staked.
Provide Liquidity: This is one of the most effective ways to earn shards, with liquidity providers receiving up to 20x shards daily.
Invite Friends: Use the referral program to invite others to join Ethena. For each successful invite, youâ€™ll receive 10% extra shards.
As the campaign continues, itâ€™s important to stay active to maximize your shard earnings. Shard distribution may become more competitive as more participants join, so engaging early and consistently can increase your chances of earning more ENA tokens.

How to Claim Your ENA Tokens
Once youâ€™ve earned shards, claiming your ENA tokens is a straightforward process: **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**


Go to the Official Airdrop Page: Start by visiting claim.ethena.fi, the official site for claiming ENA tokens.
Connect Your Wallet: Use a supported wallet like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Binance Web3 Wallet to connect to the airdrop platform. This will allow you to check your eligibility and shard balance.

For larger shard holders, 50% of your tokens will be available immediately, while the remaining 50% will be vested over the next six months. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**

Maximizing Your Shard Earnings
If you want to maximize the number of ENA tokens you can claim, here are a few tips:

Stake More USDe: Staking larger amounts of USDe will help you accumulate shards faster.
Provide Liquidity Early: The earlier you provide liquidity, the more shards youâ€™ll earn, as rates of shard distribution may decrease as the campaign progresses.
Invite More Friends: The referral program is a great way to boost your shard count by bringing in new participants to Ethena.
Why ENA Tokens Matter
The ENA token is more than just a reward â€” it gives you voting rights in the Ethena protocol. Holding ENA allows you to participate in governance decisions, influencing key aspects of the protocolâ€™s future, such as feature upgrades and allocation of resources.

As Ethena grows, the value of ENA tokens is expected to increase, making this a potentially valuable asset for long-term holders. ENA will likely be listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges after the airdrop, giving users even more flexibility to trade or hold their tokens.

Who is Eligible for the Ethena Airdrop?
Eligibility for the airdrop is based on your shard count, which is earned through interactions with the Ethena protocol. Users who have been staking, providing liquidity, or performing other activities related to USDe are most likely to qualify. To check your eligibility, simply connect your wallet to the airdrop page.
