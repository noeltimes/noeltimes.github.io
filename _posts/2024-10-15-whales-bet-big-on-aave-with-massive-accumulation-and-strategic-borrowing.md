**A large whale is making bold moves in the $AAVE market, significantly increasing their holdings over the past 48 hours.**

Nine hours ago, the whale purchased 31,173 $AAVE tokens, worth approximately $4.8 million, and deposited them into the Aave platform.

Following this, they borrowed 2.7 million $GHO from Aave, swapped it for $USDC, and deposited the $USDC into Coinbase to buy even more $AAVE.

**$AAVE and High Profile Whales** 
----------------------------------

This aggressive accumulation strategy highlights a growing trend among whales going long on $AAVE, leveraging Aave’s decentralized finance tools to increase their positions and maximize gains.

Meanwhile, Abraxas Capital Management has also been making strategic moves. They recently deposited $13 million USDC into Bybit. Prior to this, they staked $wstETH into Aave and borrowed the $USDC used for the deposit. These coordinated actions between whales and large capital managers signal a strong interest in the Aave ecosystem and broader DeFi space.
