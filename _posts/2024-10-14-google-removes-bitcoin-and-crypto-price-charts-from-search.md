 !Google Removes Bitcoin and Crypto Price Charts from Search

Google has removed live price charts for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from its search results. Users have noticed that queries like “Bitcoin price” or “Ethereum price” no longer display these charts, a feature that has been available since 2018.

This change has been in effect for several days, but it’s unclear whether it’s a temporary glitch or a permanent decision. As of now, Google has not issued an official statement explaining the removal of these charts. It could also be an experiment being conducted by the Google algorithm before the upcoming US election.

Although cryptocurrency price graphs are no longer shown, stock and index graphs remain visible in the search results. Earlier, Google offered charts that showed current rates of most popular cryptocurrencies so a user could check prices at any time.

For those who still wish to follow the cryptocurrency prices, the information is still available on Google Finance. However, it should be noted that the latest updates of this platform were captured on October 7, which suggest that there could be some technical problem with how this data is captured.

Cryptocurrency lovers will be waiting to see whether Google will bring back these price charts or whether this is going to be a new norm when it comes to the display of cryptocurrency information on the internet.

For now, users will have to use other social media apps to get updates on the prices of cryptocurrencies.
