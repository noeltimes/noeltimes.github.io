How to Claim Your Exclusive $SCR Airdrop — Step-by-Step Guide
Let’s get into the details of how you can claim your exclusive $SCR tokens from the airdrop. Follow these steps carefully to make sure you don’t miss out on this opportunity.

Step 1: Check Your Eligibility
To determine whether you’re eligible to participate in the $SCR airdrop, follow these steps:


Scroll Official Airdrop Page
Visit the Scroll Official Airdrop Page.**[Claim your Etherfi Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#78891)**
Connect your wallet (MetaMask or another supported wallet) to the platform.
The platform will automatically verify whether your wallet address is eligible for the airdrop based on your on-chain activity with Scroll before the snapshot date of October 19, 2024.
If your wallet is eligible, you will see the total number of $SCR tokens you’re entitled to claim.

Step 2: Prepare Your Wallet
Before you proceed with claiming your tokens, ensure your wallet is properly set up:

ETH for Gas Fees: Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees, which are required for any Ethereum transaction. Without sufficient ETH, you won’t be able to complete the transaction.
Correct Wallet Address: Double-check that you’re using the same wallet address that you interacted with the Scroll ecosystem through. Only this address will be eligible for claiming the tokens.
Step 3: Claim Your $SCR Tokens
Now that you’ve verified your eligibility and ensured your wallet is prepared, you can move on to claiming your tokens:

On the Scroll Official Airdrop Page, locate the “Claim” button next to the total number of $SCR tokens allocated to you.
Click on the “Claim” button, which will trigger a pop-up from your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) asking you to confirm the transaction.
Review the gas fees and transaction details, then approve the transaction.
Once approved, your $SCR tokens will be transferred to your wallet. It may take a few minutes for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum network.
Step 4: Verify Your Claim and Add $SCR to Your Wallet
After you’ve claimed your tokens, follow these steps to ensure everything has gone smoothly:

Check Your Wallet: Open your wallet to confirm that the $SCR tokens have been added to your balance. If they don’t appear immediately, you may need to add the token manually.
Add $SCR Manually: To manually add the token:
Go to your wallet’s settings and select “Add Token.”
Enter the contract address of $SCR (available on the Scroll Official Airdrop Page) and confirm the addition.
3. Your $SCR tokens should now be visible in your wallet.

Step 5: Use Your $SCR Tokens
Now that you have successfully claimed your $SCR tokens, it’s time to put them to use. Here are some ways to participate in the Scroll ecosystem:

**Governance Voting: As a $SCR holder, you can participate in voting on important decisions in the Scroll DAO. This is a key way to shape the future of Scroll and ensure it remains decentralized.
**Staking Opportunities: Look out for upcoming staking mechanisms where you can earn rewards by staking your $SCR tokens.
Trading or Holding: Once $SCR tokens are listed on exchanges, you’ll be able to trade them or hold them as a long-term investment in the Scroll ecosystem.
