Major exchanges like ByBit, Bitget, Gate, and KuCoin will feature the CATS token. Following the official listing, the on-chain claim for the airdrop will open two days later, allowing users to fully access their tokens.

Moreover, community feedback is already pouring in, with users predicting what the listing price will be. One user @raghu_ram___ shared a screenshot of the 12,432 CATS reward he received with a price prediction of $0.0003. Another user @CapoXcrypto received over 200k CATS with hopes to earn at least $60 from a price listing of $0.003.

In addition to the airdrop, CATS is preparing a major update just two days after the TGE. This will introduce customizable profile pictures (PFPs), which users can upgrade using their $CATS tokens. 

These PFPs are expected to play a key role in CATSâ€™ digital ecosystem as the project moves into Season 2. Season 2 will also feature exclusive reward pools within the CATS app, requiring $CATS tokens for access. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://eoc.page.link/85EH#78891)**
