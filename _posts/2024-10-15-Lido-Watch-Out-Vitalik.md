**Feature News:** Vitalik Buterin Proposes Changes to Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake Model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is proposing adjustments to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) model, the key point being — lowering the barriers to entry for solo stakers and speeding up transaction finality.

**Key Details from Buterin’s Blog Post:**

*   **Staking Requirements:**
    *   Current minimum: 32 ETH (~$84,000).
    *   Proposed minimum: 1 ETH (~$2,600) to encourage more solo stakers.
    *   Buterin notes that the high minimum has slowed the addition of new validators since the network hit 1 million validators in April 2024.
*   **Centralization Concerns:**
    *   Lido Finance controls 28% of staked Ethereum.
    *   Lowering the staking threshold could encourage more decentralized participation.
*   **Transaction Finality Improvements:**
    *   Current finalization takes about 15 minutes due to Ethereum’s epoch system (6.4 minutes per epoch).
    *   Buterin suggests introducing “single-slot finality,” reducing finalization time to 12 seconds.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   Buterin outlined multiple approaches to achieve single-slot finality, from advanced cryptography to multi-tiered staking models.

### Next Steps for Ethereum

*   **Upcoming Pectra Upgrade:**
    *   Developers will roll out the upgrade in two phases, with the first part scheduled for February 2025.
    *   The changes aim to refine staking rewards and further optimize the network.

Buterin’s latest proposals should spark more discussions in the Ethereum community, which are set to converge at upcoming Devcon 2024 in Bangkok, Thailand.
