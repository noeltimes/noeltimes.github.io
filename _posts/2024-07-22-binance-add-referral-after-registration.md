Discover the steps to add a referral code on Binance after you've registered. Learn how this can benefit both you and your referrer, providing access to trading fee discounts and other perks. Binance, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, offers a referral program that rewards users for inviting others to join the platform. However, many users wonder if it's possible to add a referral code after completing the registration process.

**Adding a Referral Code After Registration**

Typically, a referral code is entered during the signup process. But, Binance provides a grace period after account creation where users can still add a referral code. This feature is especially useful for those who missed the opportunity at the time of registration.

**Steps to Add a Referral Code on Binance:**

1. Log in to your Binance account.
2. Navigate to the 'Dashboard' or 'Account' section.
3. Look for the 'Referral' option.
4. Enter the referral code you wish to use.
5. Confirm the addition of the referral code.

By adding a referral code, you can enjoy reduced trading fees and other benefits provided by the Binance referral program. It's a win-win situation for both the referrer and the referee.
