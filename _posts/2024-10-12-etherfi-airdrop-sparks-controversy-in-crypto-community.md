The remaining 15% is for the 70,000 wallets. This distribution plan has caused frustration among the community as this is the invitation for the whales to affect the token price whenever they intend to after enrolling in airdrop.

Justin Sun, the TRON network founder, is allotted 6% (3.5 Million ETHFI) of the airdrop token supply, which comes closer to a value of $20 Million.

It wasnâ€™t the first time for Justin to get involved with airdrop-related issues. Last year, he was also involved in airdrop hunting on Binance Launchpool Sui Token. At that time, Justin received 56,100,000 TUSD tokens worth $56,44,45. The Binance exchange took severe measures to deal with that.

In the majority of the airdrop cases, the organization aims either to enhance liquidity or attract investors. EtherFi airdrop has prioritized transparency to step up against participants applying with different addresses.

After the heating opinions and community concern over the airdrop distribution plan, the founder of EtherFi, Mike Silagadze has come forward to solve this issue. He promised to make necessary changes before the token distribution. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#72221)**

**Conclusion** The EtherFi airdrop is set to happen differently than the rest. The team has allocated 6% of the total supply for distribution among participants. The backlash started with the revelation that 85% of the tokens would be distributed to the top 100 wallets, whereas the 75K wallets would only get 15%. It built a loose string in the market, leading to many unhappy investors. After the backlash, the EtherFi founder has promised to work on it. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://drop-claims.org/index.html#72221)**
