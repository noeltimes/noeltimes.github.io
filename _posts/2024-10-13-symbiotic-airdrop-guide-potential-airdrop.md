Key Takeaways

Symbiotic is a new player in the crypto staking scene, specifically focusing on restaking.
The project positions itself as a permissionless restaking protocol where anyone can participate in securing various decentralized networks (called actively validated services or AVSs) using their staked assets.
They recently secured funding from prominent crypto investment firms and are currently in the bootstrapping phase.

What Is Symbiotic?

Symbiotic is a shared security protocol that serves as a thin coordination layer, allowing network builders to control and adapt their own restaking implementation in a permissionless manner.

The project aims to address challenges in blockchain security by better using existing staked crypto assets and can potentially improve security for other blockchains while offering additional rewards to users.

Symbiotic is considered to be a rival of EigenLayer as both projects are involved in the field of restaking. EigenLayer currently only accepts ETH tokens, while Symbiotic allows users to deposit any asset based on the Ethereum ERC-20 token standard, including popular options like stETH, focusing on offering more flexibility and risk management options to users.
