# BNB: dApp volumes declining, but the price of Binance's crypto holds
BNB, currently the third crypto by market cap, has recorded a decrease in dApp volumes on BNB Chain by 32% in the last week. Nevertheless, the price of the token used on Binance, BNB remains at $580.

*   BNB: decline in dApp volumes but the price of Binance’s crypto holds 
*   BNB: the dApp, the DeFi but also the activities on Binance determine the price of the crypto
*   The latest news in casa BNB Chain

**BNB**, the native token of the BNB Chain, **has recorded a 32% drop in the total volumes of dApps on its network in the last seven days.** 

According to what is reported by DappRadar, the BNB Chain is in **first place for the number of dApps developed on its blockchain**. In fact, there are currently **5510 dApps on BNB Chain**, 6 more than last week. In contrast, **Ethereum is the base of 4,787 dApps.**

Nevertheless, currently the total volumes of dApps on BNB Chain are 6.92 billion dollars, compared to 10.79 billion dollars of Ethereum. 

This drop in volumes in DeFi, however, **is not affecting the price of the BNB crypto which, on the contrary, seems to hold up.** 

At the time of writing, **BNB is worth $580****, in a pump of +1.21% in the last 24 hours.** Not only that, in the last month, **BNB has reached price highs of $613 and lows of $530.**

The price of BNB somehow reflects both the activity of its network in the DeFi sector, but also the offerings of the crypto-exchange of Binance. In fact, here, BNB remains the exclusive token used for certain services such as exclusive access to the launchpad and discounts on trading fees.

BNB: the dApp, the DeFi but also the activities on Binance determine the price of the crypto
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this 2024, the price of BNB has started to flourish from March, like the rest of the crypto, in a wider range of $420 and $700. Specifically, **from June to today, the price range for BNB has narrowed to $490-$610.** 

**These fairly stable price performances** of the last few months could **reflect a sort of equilibrium that the crypto experiences in the various sectors of its use.** 

In fact, BNB is widely used in the decentralized applications of the ecosystem (dApps) for trading, staking, yield farming, real-world assets (RWA), lending, launchpads, gaming, and derivatives markets.

For example, for **Binance Launchpad**, there have recently been **criticisms about its performance,** with analysts seeing a way of acting by the **platform worsened compared to when CZ was CEO.**

In DeFi, however, concerns can also arise from the market situation and competitor blockchains. For example, at the time of writing, **the** **TVL of BNB Chain** **is 4.5 billion dollars, right in between the 6 billion dollars TVL of Solana and the 2.4 billion dollars TVL of Base.** 

The latest news in casa BNB Chain
---------------------------------

In the last month, the BNB Chain network has not stood still watching its volumes. On the contrary, there have been some developments. 

Among others, there was the **introduction of stablecoin transfer without gas fees on the chain**. This is a strategic move aimed at improving cross-chain liquidity and increasing the network’s functionality. 

Speaking instead of dApp, then, there was **the** **launch of GraFun****,** the new launchpad for memecoin on BNB Chain. The next-generation platform was supported by Floki, DWF Labs, DeXe Protocol, and HOT Protocol. 

And what if we looked at Binance and its history, last month the date of **September 29 was awaited for the release from prison of CZ**, former CEO and founder of the crypto-exchange. 

In this regard, CZ himself has promised his followers that he will be present at the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, on October 30 and 31. 

> I will be attending the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai on Oct 30-31, in my personal capacity. It’s one of the biggest web3 events of the year. See you there. ✊
