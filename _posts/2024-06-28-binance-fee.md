#### Trading Fees on Binance

Binance operates on a tiered fee structure based on your trading volume over a 30-day period and your Binance Coin (BNB) holdings. For regular users, the standard trading fee is 0.1% per transaction, both for makers and takers. This rate is already quite competitive compared to many other exchanges. However, the fee can be further reduced by increasing your trading volume or by holding a certain amount of BNB.

#### Fee Discounts

One of the key benefits of using Binance is the ability to reduce your trading fees by holding Binance Coin (BNB). By paying your trading fees with BNB, you can enjoy a 25% discount, bringing the trading fee down to 0.075%.

Additionally, Binance offers other ways to reduce your fees, including:

1. **Referral Program**: By inviting friends to join Binance, you can earn a percentage of their trading fees as a reward. This can further offset your own trading costs.

2. **VIP Program**: High-volume traders can benefit from the Binance VIP program, which offers lower fees for higher trading volumes.
